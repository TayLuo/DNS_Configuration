# DNS_Configuration
DNS, is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. DNS servers are the computers that store DNS records and handle the translation (resolution) of domain names to IP addresses. DNS works with different types of "records" that store specific information:  
  A Record: Links a domain name to an IPv4 address. 

  PTR Record: Used for reverse lookups (find a domain from an IP). 

  CNAME Record: Alias for another domain.
